        <h1 id="title">Digital databases and my opinions</h1>
        <p>This is an evergrowing list as I venture out further, but these are just the two main ones at the moment as
            of 4th of November, 2025.</p>
        <h2>Notion</h2>
        <p>Everybody has heard of Notion at one point. The way it is used differs from person to person. For me, I see
            Notion as an application meant primarily <em>only</em> for iOs and Mac, and the usage of it on Windows 11 is
            just bothersome and lagging. Some of the features Notion has though are in my opinion great, though take
            time to learn.</p>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cloud-based syncing for free (so being able to use it on multiple devices without paying)</li>
            <li>Customizable templates for various use cases (note-taking, project management, etc.)</li>
            <li>Collaboration features for team projects</li>
            <li>Integration with other apps and services</li>
            <li>Clean, simplistic UI</li>
            <li>Easy and powerful integration with iOs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Incredibly laggy and slow performing on Windows 11 application</li>
            <li>Limited offline functionality</li>
            <li>Horrible user interface on mobile</li>
            <li>Lack of features in the mobile app compared to desktop</li>
            <li>Some integrations (if not most) need a subscription</li>
            <li>Steep learning curve for advanced features</li>
            <li>Artificial intelligence shoved into the user experience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, I use Notion to keep track of my recipes!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Obsidian</h2>
        <p>Obsidian is a markdown-based note-taking application that focuses on local storage and linking notes
            together. Obsidian is really just what comes after you got tired of Notion and it's limitations. But with
            the cost of being completely free, there are some drawbacks.</p>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Local storage of notes (no cloud dependency)</li>
            <li>Powerful linking and graph view features</li>
            <li>Markdown support for easy formatting</li>
            <li>Highly customizable with plugins and themes</li>
            <li>Active community and frequent updates</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No built-in cloud syncing (requires third-party solutions such as Dropbox or Google Drive)</li>
            <li>Steeper learning curve for new users</li>
            <li>Limited collaboration features compared to cloud-based apps</li>
            <li>Everything needs a plugin</li>
            <li>The worst mobile experience I have ever had with an application, completely unusable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the moment, I use Obsidian at school to generate and keep track of my CV's (which is rather useful).</p>
