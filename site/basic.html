        <h1 id="title">BASIC</h1>
        <p>BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of high-level programming languages
            designed for ease of use. It was originally developed in the mid-1960s and has since evolved into various
            dialects, influencing COMAL, Visual Basic, and GRASS.</p>

        <p>BASIC syntax is, as the name implies, very basic, thus very easy to learn. Far more simpler than some more
            popular languages, such as Python or JavaScript. Thus reading and quickly understanding the code is
            straightforward, even for an amateur.</p>

        <pre><code>
10 PRINT "Hello, World!"
20 GOTO 10
</code></pre>
        <p>Prints <code>Hello, World!</code> indefinitely.</p>
