            <h1>WDR Paper Computer</h1>
            <p>The WDR Paper Computer is a simple, educational computer architecture designed to teach the
                fundamentals of computer science and assembly language programming. It was developed by the Westdeutscher
                Rundfunk (WDR) broadcasting company in Germany. The WDR Paper Computer uses a minimalistic instruction set and
                operates on a paper-based model, allowing users to simulate the behavior of a computer without the need for actual hardware by using just paper and pen.
