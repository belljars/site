        <h1 id="title">Journal and notebook brand reviews</h1>
        <p>As a journaling enthusiast, I have tried various journal and notebook brands over the years. Here are some of
            my personal reviews on the ones I've used for an extensive time:</p>
        <h2>Moleskine</h2>
        <p>The classic. The OG. The goat of all the possible ones in the market. Nothing stands between the absolute
            quality which is a Moleskine journal. Each type an absolute perfection, taking every type of pen and pencil
            like a dream. Beautiful, high quality paper which nothing could compare. With the cost of being expensive, I
            say that the Moleskine is worth it all.</p>
        <p style="opacity: 50%;"><em>Please sponsor me Moleskine, I also love your sketchbooks (which handle all types
                of mediums amazingly well).</em></p>
        <h2>Leuchtturm1917</h2>
        <p>Is it a crime to say that the only reason it is so popular is only due to the high amount of colors it comes
            in? Paper quality? I'd say it's decent, but not mind-blowing. The bullet journal community loves it for its
            dot grid layout and numbered pages, but I find it a bit overrated. I don't like the number of pages, and it
            at times feels a bit too bulky for my taste.</p>
        <p>Is it worth the hype? No. Writing in one is like forcing one to try and eat a dry piece of bread. You can do
            it, but dammit, it's not enjoyable.</p>
        <h2>Victoria's Journals</h2>
        <p>Possibly the cutest one out of any brand, and the most cheapest too. Not much to say. It is nice and come
            with all types of journals and notebooks. Second favourite. I do wonder why it is not as popular!</p>
