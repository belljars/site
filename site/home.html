        <h2>Coding a website is for some reason more complicated when you try to automate everything</h2>
        <p>It is embarrassing when it seems like you keep on forgetting everything you learned about the basics of
            frontend, with the logical side of programmming forcing you to do things the hard way with little to no
            reward. So my plan is to instead do things the manual way instead of spending hours trying to make
            everything work perfectly (when they don't).</p>
        <h2>What is only-skin?</h2>
        <p><span class="tooltip"> only-skin</span> is a digital name I chose on a whim due to me not having a proper name idea for a blog (and because my GitHub user was taken). <em>But</em> for the reasons to make a blog site
            is for the simple reason as to document things (and have it serve as a personal archive digitally).</p>
        <p>If it is possible, I highly prefer journaling on paper. My favourite brand is Moleskine due to the paper and
            cover quality. Favourite pen to write with depends, but is either a Pilot G2 or a HB pencil.</p>

        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>At the moment I am a seventeen year old girl named Alina who likes tinkering with her own computer which has
            suffered through many distro-hoppings and high-risk experiences with little to no reward other than an
            answer as to <em>why</em>? But when I am not raging on Vim because I do not understand the plugins I am
            either reading books or articles (non-fiction, classical fiction, philosophy and politics), scrolling
            through other people's blogs, or journaling.</p>
        <p>My favourite book is Stoner by John Williams and film is The Quiet Girl (2022) directed by Colm Bairéad. I
            like autumn and cold, grey days, and with salted caramel latte with cold foam and a good playlist. My
            favourite Moomin characters are Snufkin and his dad The Joxter.</p>
        <h2>Why make a website?</h2>
        <p>Why not?</p>
        <h2>Why make it simple?</h2>
        <p>Because I genuinely do not care that much. As long as I get my wanted intent across and it is easy to read
            from raw code I will try my best at keeping simple.</p>
        <p>As for the layout, I prefer to make it easy on every possible screen and device. Not every person is
            privledged enough to have a high-end computer or a large monitor, so I want to ensure that my website is
            accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
        <h2>Why not use a framework?</h2>
        <p>If I am not working on a professional project I see no reason to complicate things with a framework. Rather,
            making my own framework seems like a better project idea (and for my CV). Also because I do not know how to
            use any for these types of projects...</p>
        <h2>Do you use Linux?</h2>
        <p>OpenBSD doesn't want to recognize my wireless network chip for some reason so yes. I prefer NixOS, but
            sometimes use Fedora for when I don't want to deal with configuration files and just want to get stuff done
            quickly (like school work). I am also very fond of Q4OS. My first distro was Arch Linux, which took me an
            hour to install first time.</p>
        <p>But at school I use Windows 11, which I sometimes have an embarrassing amount of struggles with (how
            unintuitive can something be?)</p>
        <p>But if I could, I would use no operating system, just a journal and a pen.</p>
