# site

Minimal static site generator for my own personal archive. To use this, just empty the content directory.
Highly customizable in `src/css/base.css`

## usage

```bash
node build.js
```
It will rebuild `output` folder, which the HTML site will be located in, so there is no need for manual deletion.
